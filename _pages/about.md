I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student of [TIGER-Lab][12] at [University of Waterloo][7], advised by Prof. [Wenhu Chen][6]. Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science at [Zhejiang University][0]. I have interned at at [Allen Institute for AI][11] in summer 2024, supervised by [Bill Yuchen Lin][5] and [Lianhui Qin][10].

My research focus on General Artificial Intelligence and their applications. I am particularly interested in understanding the behavior of LLMs and and multimodality reasoning, as well as their evaluation.
