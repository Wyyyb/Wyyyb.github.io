I'm a CS Ph.D. student at [TIGER-Lab][0] in [University of Waterloo][1], advised by Prof. [Wenhu Chen][2]. Previously, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from [UC Davis][3]. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Chu Kochen Honors College][4], [Zhejiang University][5]. From 2021 to 2023, I worked as a full-time NLP Algorithm Engineer at [Tencent Smart Healthcare][6].

My research focuses on General Artificial Intelligence and its applications. I am particularly interested in understanding the behaviour of LLMs, multimodal reasoning, and their evaluation.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
